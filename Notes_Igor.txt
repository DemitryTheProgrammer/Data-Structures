Data - any information stores in or used by a computer.

Abstract Data Types - A logical model for data Types
                    - Defines data and operations but no implementation.

Algorithm - Takes input to give output.
                    - Essential aspect of data structures
                    - Efficiency is preferred

Evaluating Algorithm Efficiency
        - Avoid using Real-Time Units
        - Use Logical Units
    - Complexity: describes the effieciency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of date that algorithm must process.
        - Time Complexity: the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input.
        - Space Complexity: describes the amount of memort an algorithm takes in terms of amount of input.

Big-O-Notation - can be described as an upper bound for a complexity function
